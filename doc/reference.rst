        $ cpanel list mail accounts

**list mail filters ACCOUNT**
    Lists mail filters associated to ACCOUNT. Output is a JSON-formatted
    array of filter names.

    ACCOUNT is the name of a cPanel email account, usually user@domain

    *Example*

    .. code:: sh

        $ cpanel list mail filters scott@example.com

**get mail filter ACCOUNT FILTERNAME**
    Return a JSON-formatted description of email filter FILTERNAME associated
    to email ACCOUNT. To get a list of current filter names, use
    ``cpanel list mail filters ACCOUNT``

    *Example*

    .. code:: sh

        $ cpanel get mail filter scott@example.com spamkiller

**set mail filter ACCOUNT FILE**
    Create or update an email filter associated with email ACCOUNT.
    If the filter already exists, it updates it; otherwise, it creates a new filter.
    Use a JSON FILE to describe the filter rules. This JSON FILE has the same
    textual format as the output from ``cpanel get mail filter``, so the easiest way
    to create a new filter is to dump an existing filter into a ``filter.json`` file,
    edit it and then upload it with ``cpanel set mail filter``.
    See the example below.

    *Example*

    .. code:: sh

        $ cpanel get mail filter scott@example.com spamkiller > filter.json

        # Edit filter.json, and then run:
        $ cpanel set mail filter scott@example.com filter.json

**delete mail filter ACCOUNT FILTERNAME**
    Delete email filter FILTERNAME associated to ACCOUNT. To get a list of current
    filter names, use ``cpanel list mail filters ACCOUNT``

    *Example*

    .. code:: sh

        $ cpanel delete mail filter scott@example.com spamkiller
