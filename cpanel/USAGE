    cpanel list backups

\033[1mCOMMANDS\033[0m

All ‘create backup’ commands create a backup tarball (a .tar.gz file) of
the user’s home directory along with other account data, such as the crontab,
API tokens, log files and DB data. The backup tarball’s name is
backup-MM.DD.YYYY_HH-MM-SS_USERNAME.tar.gz.

If you pass an optional EMAIL argument, the backup engine will send a
confirmation email after it completes the backup.

\033[1mcreate backup home [EMAIL]\033[0m

\033[1mcreate backup ftp USERNAME PASSWORD HOST [DIRECTORY] [EMAIL]\033[0m

    HOST is the hostname of the remote FTP server.
    USERNAME and PASSWORD are the credentials to log in to it.
    Optional DIRECTORY is the destination directory on the remote server;
    by default use the remote user’s login directory. Note that DIRECTORY
    is not an absolute path, but a path relative to the login directory, i.e.,
    /public corresponds to <remote login directory>/public.

\033[1mcreate backup scp USERNAME PASSWORD HOST [DIRECTORY] [EMAIL]\033[0m

Usage:
    cpanel list dir indexing PATH

\033[1mINDEXING COMMANDS\033[0m

The indexing of a remote directory controls how to present that directory
to a web browser if no default HTML index page is found.

There are four possible index settings:

- ‘inherit’: Use the parent directory’s setting.
- ‘disabled’: a.k.a. No Indexing, do not list the directory contents.
- ‘standard’: a.k.a. Show Filename Only, list only the directory’s file names.
- ‘fancy’: a.k.a. Show Filename and Description,
   list the directory’s file names, sizes and types.

cPanel uses a .htaccess directive in the remote directory to control the
index settings. For instance, for ‘fancy’, it adds the following to htaccess:

    Options +Indexes
    IndexOptions +HTMLTable +FancyIndexing

See \033[0;34mhttps://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/advanced/indexes/\033[00m for further information.

Note that the PATH in all commands below is not absolute, but relative to the
remote login directory, i.e., /public_html corresponds to
<remote login directory>/public_html.

\033[1mlist dir indexing PATH\033[0m
    List the index settings for remote PATH and its subdirectories (children).
    Output is JSON-formatted.

    EXAMPLE
        \033[1;34mcpanel list dir indexing /public_html\033[00m

\033[1mget dir indexing PATH\033[0m
    Get the index setting for remote PATH only. Output is JSON-formatted.

    EXAMPLE
        \033[1;34mcpanel get dir indexing /public_html\033[00m

\033[1mset dir indexing PATH TYPE\033[0m
    Set the index setting for remote PATH. Possible values for TYPE are
    ‘inherit’, ‘disabled’, ‘standard’ or ‘fancy’.

    EXAMPLE
        \033[1;34mcpanel set dir indexing /public_html fancy\033[00m

\033[1mPRIVACY COMMANDS\033[0m

cPanel can password-protect remote directories for privacy. Any attempt to
access a private directory using a web browser will prompt for a
username and password.

The actual underlying authentication method is Basic HTTP authentication;
these users and passwords are local to the directory, they are not cPanel users.

Note that the PATH in all commands below is not absolute, but relative to the
remote login directory, i.e., /public_html corresponds to
<remote login directory>/public_html.

\033[1mlist dir privacy PATH\033[0m
    List the privacy settings for remote PATH and its subdirectories (children).
    Output is JSON-formatted.

    EXAMPLE
        \033[1;34mcpanel list dir privacy /public_html\033[00m

\033[1mget dir privacy PATH\033[0m
    Get the privacy settings for remote PATH only. Output is JSON-formatted.
    You can enable or disable password protection using
    ‘cpanel enable dir privacy’ or ‘cpanel disable dir privacy’ (see below).

    EXAMPLE
        \033[1;34mcpanel get dir privacy /public_html\033[00m

\033[1menable dir privacy PATH\033[0m
    Enable password protection for PATH. Note that you need to add users
    using ‘cpanel add dir user’ (see below) to grant access to PATH.

    EXAMPLE
        \033[1;34mcpanel enable dir privacy /public_html\033[00m

\033[1mdisable dir privacy PATH\033[0m
    Disable password protection for PATH.

    EXAMPLE
        \033[1;34mcpanel disable dir privacy /public_html\033[00m

\033[1mUSER MANAGEMENT COMMANDS\033[0m

cPanel grants access to remote password-protected directories using
ad hoc users and passwords specific to every directory. Use the
commands below to manage these users.

cPanel stores the credentials in a .htpasswd file.
See \033[0;34mhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.htpasswd\033[00m for further information.

Note that the PATH in all commands below is not absolute, but relative to the
remote login directory, i.e., /public_html corresponds to
<remote login directory>/public_html.

\033[1madd dir user PATH USER PASSWORD\033[0m
    Add USER with corresponding PASSWORD to the list of allowed users
    for PATH.

    EXAMPLE
        \033[1;34mcpanel add dir user /public_html scott tiger\033[00m

\033[1mdelete dir user PATH USER\033[0m
    Remove USER from the list of allowed users for PATH.

    EXAMPLE
        \033[1;34mcpanel delete dir user /public_html scott\033[00m

\033[1mlist dir users PATH\033[0m
    List allowed users for PATH. Output is JSON-formatted.

    EXAMPLE
        \033[1;34mcpanel list users /public_html\033[00m

\033[1mLEECH PROTECTION COMMANDS\033[0m

Leech protection adds some basic measures against the abuse of
password-protected directories. The system allows a maximum number of
logins per hour for a leech-protected directory.

See \033[0;34mhttps://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/security/leech-protection/\033[00m for further information.

\033[1mlist dir protection PATH\033[00m
    List leech protection status for PATH and its subdirectories (children).
    Output is JSON-formatted.

    EXAMPLE
        \033[1;34mcpanel list dir protection /public_html\033[00m

Usage:
    cpanel list mail accounts
    cpanel list mail filters ACCOUNT
    cpanel get mail filter ACCOUNT FILTERNAME
    cpanel set mail filter ACCOUNT FILE
    cpanel delete mail filter ACCOUNT FILTERNAME

COMMANDS

\033[1mlist mail accounts\033[0m
    List cPanel email accounts. Output is JSON-formatted.

    EXAMPLE
        \033[1;34mcpanel list mail accounts\033[00m

\033[1mlist mail filters ACCOUNT\033[0m
    List mail filters associated to ACCOUNT. Output is a JSON-formatted
    array of filter names.
    ACCOUNT is the name of a cPanel email account, usually user@domain

    EXAMPLE
        \033[1;34mcpanel list mail filters scott@example.com\033[00m

\033[1mget mail filter ACCOUNT FILTERNAME\033[0m
    Return a JSON-formatted description of email filter FILTERNAME associated
    to email ACCOUNT. To get a list of current filter names, use
    ‘cpanel list mail filters ACCOUNT’

    EXAMPLE
        \033[1;34mcpanel get mail filter scott@example.com spamkiller\033[00m

\033[1mset mail filter ACCOUNT FILE\033[0m
    Create or update an email filter associated with email ACCOUNT.
    If the filter already exists, it updates it; otherwise, it creates a new filter.
    Use a JSON FILE to describe the filter rules. This JSON FILE has the same
    textual format as the output from ‘cpanel get mail filter’, so the easiest way
    to create a new filter is to dump an existing filter into a filter.json file,
    edit it and then upload it with ‘cpanel set mail filter’.
    See the EXAMPLE below.

    EXAMPLE
        \033[1;34mcpanel get mail filter scott@example.com spamkiller > filter.json\033[00m
        # Edit filter.json, and then run:
        \033[1;34mcpanel set mail filter scott@example.com filter.json\033[00m

\033[1mdelete mail filter ACCOUNT FILTERNAME\033[0m
    Delete email filter FILTERNAME associated to ACCOUNT. To get a list of current
    filter names, use ‘cpanel list mail filters ACCOUNT’

    EXAMPLE
         \033[1;34mcpanel delete mail filter scott@example.com spamkiller\033[00m
