All ‘create backup’ commands create a backup tarball (a .tar.gz file) of
the user’s home directory along with other account data, such as the crontab,
API tokens, log files and DB data. The backup tarball’s name is

If you pass an optional EMAIL argument, the backup engine will send a
confirmation email after it completes the backup.

create backup home [EMAIL]

set mail filter ACCOUNT FILE
    Create or update an email filter associated with email ACCOUNT.
    If the filter already exists, it updates it; otherwise, it creates a new filter.
    Use a JSON FILE to describe the filter rules. This JSON FILE has the same
    textual format as the output from ‘cpanel get mail filter’, so the easiest way
    to create a new filter is to dump an existing filter into a filter.json file,
    edit it and then upload it with ‘cpanel set mail filter’.
    See the EXAMPLE below.

    EXAMPLE
        cpanel get mail filter scott@example.com spamkiller > filter.json
        # Edit filter.json, and then run:
        cpanel set mail filter scott@example.com filter.json

delete mail filter ACCOUNT FILTERNAME
    Delete email filter FILTERNAME associated to ACCOUNT. To get a list of current
    filter names, use ‘cpanel list mail filters ACCOUNT’
