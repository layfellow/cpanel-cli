    cpanel create backup scp USERNAME PASSWORD HOST [DIRECTORY] [EMAIL]
    cpanel list backups

For a complete User’s Guide go to: https://cpanel-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

COMMANDS

All ‘create backup’ commands create a backup tarball (a .tar.gz file) of
the user’s home directory along with other account data, such as the crontab,
API tokens, log files and DB data. The backup tarball’s name is
backup-MM.DD.YYYY_HH-MM-SS_USERNAME.tar.gz.

If you pass an optional EMAIL argument, the backup engine will send a
confirmation email after it completes the backup.

create backup home [EMAIL]
    Create a backup tarball and store it in the user’s home directory itself.

create backup ftp USERNAME PASSWORD HOST [DIRECTORY] [EMAIL]
    Create a backup tarball and store it on a remote FTP server.

    HOST is the hostname of the remote FTP server.
    USERNAME and PASSWORD are the credentials to log in to it.
    Optional DIRECTORY is the destination directory on the remote server;
    by default use the remote user’s login directory. Note that DIRECTORY
    is not an absolute path, but a path relative to the login directory, i.e.,
    /public corresponds to <remote login directory>/public.

create backup scp USERNAME PASSWORD HOST [DIRECTORY] [EMAIL]
    Create a backup tarball and store it on a remote SCP server.

    USERNAME, PASSWORD, HOST and DIRECTORY are the same as for ‘create backup ftp’.

    EXAMPLES
        cpanel backup home
        cpanel backup home scott@example.com
        cpanel backup ftp scott tiger ftp.example.com
        cpanel backup ftp scott tiger ftp.example.com /backup
        cpanel backup scp scott tiger ssh.example.com /backup scott@example.com

list backups
    List the account’s backup files. Output is JSON-formatted.

Usage:
    cpanel list mail accounts
    cpanel list mail filters ACCOUNT
    cpanel get mail filter ACCOUNT FILTERNAME
    cpanel set mail filter ACCOUNT FILE
    cpanel delete mail filter ACCOUNT FILTERNAME

For a complete User’s Guide go to: https://cpanel-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

COMMANDS

list mail accounts
    Lists cPanel email accounts. Output is JSON-formatted.

    EXAMPLE
        cpanel list mail accounts

list mail filters ACCOUNT
    Lists mail filters associated to ACCOUNT. Output is a JSON-formatted
    array of filter names.
    ACCOUNT is the name of a cPanel email account, usually user@domain

    EXAMPLE
        cpanel list mail filters scott@example.com

get mail filter ACCOUNT FILTERNAME
    Return a JSON-formatted description of email filter FILTERNAME associated
    to email ACCOUNT. To get a list of current filter names, use
    ‘cpanel list mail filters ACCOUNT’

    EXAMPLE
        cpanel get mail filter scott@example.com spamkiller

set mail filter ACCOUNT FILE
    Create or update an email filter associated with email ACCOUNT.
    If the filter already exists, it updates it; otherwise, it creates a new filter.
    Use a JSON FILE to describe the filter rules. This JSON FILE has the same
    textual format as the output from ‘cpanel get mail filter’, so the easiest way
    to create a new filter is to dump an existing filter into a filter.json file,
    edit it and then upload it with ‘cpanel set mail filter’.
    See the EXAMPLE below.

    EXAMPLE
        cpanel get mail filter scott@example.com spamkiller > filter.json
        # Edit filter.json, and then run:
        cpanel set mail filter scott@example.com filter.json

delete mail filter ACCOUNT FILTERNAME
    Delete email filter FILTERNAME associated to ACCOUNT. To get a list of current
    filter names, use ‘cpanel list mail filters ACCOUNT’

    EXAMPLE
         cpanel delete mail filter scott@example.com spamkiller
