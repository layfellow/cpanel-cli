Usage: cpanel [OPTIONS] COMMAND...

A command line interface for the cPanel Unrestricted API.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help                  print this help and exit
    -V, --version               print version information and exit
    -H HOST, --hostname=HOST    cPanel server hostname
    -U USER, --username=USER    username on cPanel server
    -T UTOKEN, --utoken=UTOKEN  UAPI token associated to USER

AUTHENTICATION
You can pass the HOST, USER and UTOKEN credentials directly as options, as
shown above, or, better yet, write a .cpanelrc file on your $HOME
directory. See the Authentication section in the User’s Guide at:
https://cpanel-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#authentication

COMMAND is a sequence of two or more keywords describing a task; the general
form of the command keyword list is:

    \033[1mcpanel VERB MODULE TARGET [ARGUMENTS...]\033[0m

EXAMPLES
    \033[1;34mcpanel list features\033[00m
    \033[1;34mcpanel list mail accounts\033[00m
    \033[1;34mcpanel get mail filter scott@example.com spamkiller\033[00m

Notice the keywords follow the natural English sentence order, i.e.,
‘list features’, ‘get mail filter’, etc.

Output from most commands is JSON-formatted, except for commands that set or change
remote state.
